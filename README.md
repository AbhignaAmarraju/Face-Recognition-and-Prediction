# Face-Recognition-and-Identification
The model is be able to recognize the faces most accurately even if the images of the person are blurry, or with extra  filters, or even if the images of the person are little old and even if the images are at different angles. The model is developed using CNN. The image processing technique using keras is performed on a training dataset to process the image and obtain pixel values. Since we are working with coloured images each pixel has three different values called RGB(Red Blue Green) values as a combination RGB can produce all possible colour pallets. Various layers are used as part of the Neural Network to train the model to produce accurate predictions.
